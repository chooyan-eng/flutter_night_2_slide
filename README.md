# Build Dynamic Slide Decks with Flutter 

This presentation introduces how building slide decks with Flutter is valuable and how powerful `flutter_deck` is for achieving this.

The slide deck is available on https://chooyan-eng.github.io/flutter_night_2_slide in both English / Japanese (original presentation was made in Japanese).

If you want to run locally, just

```sh
git clone git@github.com:chooyan-eng/slide_decks_with_flutter.git
cd slide_decks_with_flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
